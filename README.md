👋 Hi, I’m Nokwanda — an aspiring Cloud Engineer / Cloud Security Engineer based in South Africa 🇿🇦

☁️ I’m currently taking part in the #100DaysOfCloud challenge, learning hands-on through the Learn to Cloud guide. My primary cloud provider is Microsoft Azure, where I’m building foundational skills and real-world projects along the way.

📚 I’m still learning (and enjoying the process!), with a clear goal of stepping into a Cloud Engineering role by the end of 2026 🌱 Consistency, learning, and continuous improvement are my main focus.

✨ Fun fact: I’ve started managing my life like a project — complete with planning, tracking, and milestones. The project is me. Let’s see how it goes by the end of the year 😄
